# Guided Project: Mobile App for Lottery Addiction. Determining Business Logic of the App
## Motivation

Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.

In this guided project we aim to build a business logic of a dedicated mobile app that is to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. We will focus on the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49'>6/49 lottery</a> and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:

- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?

As part of the project, we will also consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset'>The data set</a> has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018.
